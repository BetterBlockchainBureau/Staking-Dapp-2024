Staking Info
$BUD can pay 5% DAILY or even more, according to the current mining efficiency rate. The mining efficiency rate rises and falls as you and other players hire Bud Tenders, compound their $BUD and harvest their $BUD.

The object of the game is hiring more Bud Tenders, sooner and more often than other players. This in turn earns you more $BUD faster. Hiring more Bud Tenders using your daily $BUD earnings can 3x your Bud Tenders within 30 days or less.
